# Wastelanders

Wastelanders is a console RPG with elements from DnD/Fallout/Pokemon.
It is a turn-based game with the goal of scoring the best score you can.

## Start

Wastelanders are intended to run on the PIPBOI system([GitHub here](https://github.com/MurasakiAki/pipboi)), it can be run as a standalone game, but it requires additional steps.

### For PIPBOI

If you have PIPBOI installed, simply move `wastelanders` folder into `pipboi/mods` folder. Run PIPBOI and then you can run Wastelanders via commands.

### Standalone game

You can try running the `main.sh` script with a `username` input.
It may not work. **Running Wastelnders outside of PIPBOI system is not recommended nor supported.**

## How it works?

Wastelanders are written in Bash script, with additional header files and class files.
